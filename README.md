## Simple checkers game

Console application to play checkers against the computer.
Written in `Haskell` using `UI.Ncurses library` for frontend.

Application can be configured with `unicheckers.conf` file.
You can use also `/etc/unicheckers.conf` file that will be overwritten by the local one.
Config example with default values (which will be used even without `.conf` file) is in repository. 

Known issues

- Troubles with randomizer initialization
- Some questions about rules when King is eating
- If checker become King after eating turn is switching to another player regardless can this checker eat again or not
- AI is making redundant calculations even if the single turn is possible at the moment
